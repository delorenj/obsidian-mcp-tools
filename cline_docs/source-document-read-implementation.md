# Source Document Read Implementation

## Initial Objective

Implement the read feature for source documents that enables paginated access to content through:

- Shared types/schemas for validation
- MCP tool implementation
- REST API endpoint in the Obsidian plugin
- Integration with provided pagination utilities

## Tasks

### Types & Schemas

- [x] Add readSourceSchema to shared package
- [x] Add pageResponseSchema to shared package
- [x] Export type definitions

### MCP Tool

- [x] Implement source_read tool
- [x] Add request validation
- [x] Add response validation
- [x] Add error handling

### Plugin REST API

- [x] Add GET endpoint for /sources/:documentId
- [x] Integrate pagination service
- [x] Add error handling
- [x] Add response validation

## Progress Notes

### Initial Steps

- Analyzed requirements from read.md
- Reviewed provided pagination utilities
- Created task tracking document

### Implementation Details

1. Shared Types (packages/shared/src/types/source-document.ts):

   - Added readSourceSchema for request validation
   - Added pageResponseSchema for response validation
   - Added detailed JSDoc documentation
   - Exported TypeScript types

2. MCP Tool (packages/mcp-server/src/features/source-document/index.ts):

   - Implemented source_read tool with proper name and schema
   - Added request parameter validation
   - Added response validation
   - Implemented error handling
   - Returns formatted content with page info

3. REST API (packages/obsidian-plugin/src/features/source-documents/index.ts):
   - Added GET /sources/:documentId endpoint
   - Integrated pagination service
   - Added document existence checks
   - Added error handling
   - Added response validation

### Testing Notes

The implementation leverages the existing test coverage for:

- Block splitting (blocks.test.ts)
- Page extraction (pagination.test.ts)

These tests verify the core functionality used by the read feature.

### Integration Notes

- Used shared exports through $/shared alias
- Leveraged existing pagination utilities
- Maintained consistent code organization
- Followed project's architectural patterns

### Final Status

âœ… All implementation tasks completed successfully

- Types and schemas implemented with documentation
- MCP tool implemented with validation and error handling
- REST API endpoint implemented with pagination
- Integration with existing utilities verified
